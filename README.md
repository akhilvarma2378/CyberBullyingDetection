# CyberBullyingDetection

Nowadays, a lot of people indulge themselves in the world of social media. After Covid-19 Pandemic this engagement has only increased as people often rely on social media platforms to express their emotions, find comfort, find like-minded individuals, and form communities. With this extensive use of social media comes many downsides and one of the downsides is cyberbully. Cyberbullying is a form of online harassment that is both unsettling and troubling. It can take many forms, but the most common is a textual format. Cyberbullying is common on social media, and people often end up in a mental breakdown state instead of taking action against the bully. Many incidents have recently occurred worldwide due to online harassment, such as sharing private chats, rumors, and sexual remarks. Therefore, the identification of bullying texts or messages on social media has gained a growing amount of attention among researchers. We have proposed a cyberbullying detection system to address this issue. The main purpose of this project is to design and develop an effective Model to detect online abusive and bullying messages by merging natural language processing and machine learning. This project takes a text as input and checks whether it involves any kind of cyberbullying or not.
